Just a Solver for Strata game

Usage is pretty simple:
1) Here is some terminology and assumptions:
Size - side size of the board.
I.e. you play 2x2 game then size = 2.
If you play 3x3 game then size = 3.
The cells of the board are numbered beginning at the top left, left to right, top to bottom
I.e if you have 2x2 game then the board cells are
    0 1
    2 3
If you have 3x3 game then the board cells are
    0 1 2
    3 4 5
    6 7 8

Etc.

The lines where you can make a stripe are numbered as follows:
First, all horizontal stripes are numbered from 0 to size - 1.
Then, all vertical stripes are numbered from size to size * size - 1.

Therefore if you have 2x2 game then
    0
    1
     2 3

If you have 3x3 game then
    0
    1
    2
     3 4 5

For each colour you should assign a number between 0 and colours - 1
Note that correspondence between colours and numbers must be unique.
So you cannot assign the same number to two different colours.
2) Create instance of StrataGame: StrataGame strataGame = new StrataGame(size, colours),
where size - dimension of the board (i.e. if your game field is 2x2 then you should set it to 2)
, colours - the number of colours used in the current instance of game (i.e if you have stripes of 3 colours, you should set it to 3).
3) for each position which is not blank call: strataGame.setPosColour(i, colour)
where i - is position on the board, colour - the colour of the the cell
4) To get a solution call: Queue<Move> moves = StrataSolver.solve(strataGame);
5) If there are no solutions then moves.size() will be 0.
6) To get steps leading to victory iterate through a Queue, on each step receiving instance of Move
which has two properties "move" and "colour". They can be read by methods "getMove" and "getColour" of class Move respectively.
Let's say you play a game 2x2 and you have got the following step: 1 (less than "size") for move, and 2 for colour.
It means that you should make a stripe of colour #2 (which you assigned to real colour in step 1) on the second row
(rows are numbered from zero, so the first row is numbered 0, second - 1, etc)
If you got a number for a move equal or larger than "size" then it means that you should make vertical stripe for column ("move" - "size").
Note that columns are numbered from 0 too.
So if you "move" - "size" = 1 then it means that you make a stripe on second column.
Let's say you play a game 3x3 and you have got the following step: 4 (larger or equal than "size") for move, and 0 for colour.
It means that you should make a stripe on second column (4 - 3 = 1, columns are numbered from 0).
